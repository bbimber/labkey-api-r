Description: The 'LabKey' client library for R makes it easy for R users to
    load live data from a 'LabKey' Server, <https://www.labkey.com/>,
    into the R environment for analysis, provided users have permissions
    to read the data. It also enables R users to insert, update, and
    delete records stored on a 'LabKey' Server, provided they have appropriate
    permissions to do so.
